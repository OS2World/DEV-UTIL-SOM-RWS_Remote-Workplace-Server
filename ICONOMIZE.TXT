 - About Iconomize -
_______________________________________________________________________________

Iconomize is a unique ini-maintenance tool that lets you eliminate the single
largest source of bloat in os2.ini:  duplicate icon data.  Running Iconomize
just once can reduce the size of your os2.ini anywhere from 10% to 25%.

One of the nicest features of the WPS is the ease with which you can assign
a customized icon to an object.  For program objects and the like, that icon
is stored in os2.ini.  Unfortunately, many of these "custom" icons are totally
unnecessary because they're exact copies the object's default icon.  Each one
of these duplicated icons adds 4-12K of useless bloat to os2.ini.  Iconomize
lets you delete the duplicates and reduce the bloat.

Iconomize was created to demonstrate the features of Remote Workplace Server
("RWS").  RWS enables stand-alone programs to interact with the WPS as though
they were part of it.  Programs can manipulate WPS objects in ways that were
not available previously:  query their titles, paths, icons, etc.; popup their
menus; and more.  RWS is an open-source project.  Contributions of code from
developers and suggestions from users is encouraged. To foster widespread use,
RWS is licensed under the generous terms of the Mozilla Public License.

 - Installing Iconomize -
_______________________________________________________________________________

Both Iconomize v0.80 and its companion utility, FPos v0.80, require access
to the dlls rwssrv08 and rwscli08.  Other programs may require these as well.
You have two choices:

- put Iconomize.exe, the two dlls, and FPos.exe (if you have it) in the same
  directory
- put the two dlls in a directory that's on your LIBPATH, & put Iconomize.exe
  (and FPos.exe) wherever you wish

The first time you run Iconomize, it will register the "RWS08" WPS class. This
class, contained in RwsSrv08.Dll, hosts the server portion of Remote Workplace
Server.  It creates no permanent objects and will only be loaded by the WPS
when you run a program that uses RWS.

Note:  Each version of RWS operates independently and will never conflict
with earlier or later versions.  You can run programs that require different
versions of the RWS dlls simultaneously without any compatibility problems.

 - Using Iconomize -
_______________________________________________________________________________

When Iconomize loads, it has to "wake up" every WPS object that has an entry
in PM_Abstract:Icons.  This may take several seconds.  For every entry, the
display will identify the object's:  custom icon, default icon, and title.
It will also show the icon's size, the entry's key in os2.ini, & the object's
fully-qualified path.

Initially, the list is sorted by title.  You can click on the heading for any
column that contains text to sort the list in ascending order based on that
column.  Clicking on the heading again will resort it in descending order.
Clicking on the "Custom" column sorts the list by status (i.e. deleted/not
deleted).  If you want to reverse the ascending/descending indicators, you
can do so from the Options->Sort Indicators menu.

To delete items, doubleclick on them, or press Delete or Enter, or click
MB2 and select Delete or Undelete from the popup menu.  Items will be marked
with cross-hatching in the "Custom" column.  Icons will not be deleted from
os2.ini until you close Iconomzie or select one of the options on the File
menu.  You will then be asked to confirm that you want to delete them.

Right-clicking on a group of selected items presents a limited menu that
lets you delete or undelete all of them.  Right-clicking on a single item
provides a more versatile menu.  You can:  save the custom icon to file,
open the object, locate the object (i.e. open the folder containing it),
or popup the object's WPS menu.

When you close Iconomize's main window or any of its popup windows, it will
save the window's size, position, colors and fonts.  Closing Iconomize will
also save the current sort order and any settings you've changed.  To reset
everything to its original values, select 'Restore defaults' on the Options
menu, then restart Iconomize.

!Important!  After you reset an object's icon, it may not display the correct
icon when you open the folder containing it.  The object's Properties notebook
will show the correct icon;  after you restart the WPS, the folder will too.

Even after you've eliminated all of the duplicate icons, you may feel that
there are still too many icons stored in os2.ini.  Of course, you can simply
delete the icons for objects you don't use very often - but there may be a
better way.

If an .exe doesn't have its own icon, the system looks for an icon file with
the same name.  For example, if xyz.exe lacks an icon, the WPS will look for
xyz.ico and use that icon.  Program objects for xyz will not be listed by
Iconomize because xyz's icon is not stored in os2.ini.

When you find an object that has an assigned icon, you can use the 'Save Icon'
option to create an .ico file that matches the .exe.  Unfortunately, Iconomize
can't determine the correct name and location for the icon, so it offers to
create a file in the same folder as the program object.  You can either update
the name and directory in the Save As dialog or use the defaults and perform
a copy/rename later.

Hint:  if you have the program object's Properties notebook open when you do
this, you can copy the exe's name and path to the file dialog;  then, all you
have to do is change the file extension from .exe to .ico).

Once that's done, you can use Iconomize to reset the program object to its
default.  The program object will still show the same icon as before, only
now the icon will come from the .ico file and not os2.ini.

A note of caution:  be sure the program object in question refers to xyz.exe
and not cmd.exe or a .cmd file.  This trick will not work if it does.
